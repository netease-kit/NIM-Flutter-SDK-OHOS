# nim_core_platform_interface

A common platform interface for the [`nim_core`][1] plugin.

This interface allows platform-specific implementations of the `nim_core`
plugin, as well as the plugin itself, to ensure they are supporting the same interface.

## Usage

To implement a new platform-specific implementation of `nim_core`, extend
[`NimCorePlatform`][2] with an implementation that performs the platform-specific behavior, and when
you register your plugin, set the default
`NimCorePlatform` by calling
`NimCorePlatform.instance = MyService()`.

## Note on breaking changes

Strongly prefer non-breaking changes (such as adding a method to the interface)
over breaking changes for this package.

See https://flutter.dev/go/platform-interface-breaking-changes for a discussion on why a less-clean
interface is preferable to a breaking change.
